### Suggested Placement and Phrasing for the Disclaimer

You can place the disclaimer in the introduction or in a "Note" section after explaining the purpose of the tool, specifically mentioning that it’s not yet compatible with **COMPUTE! Magazine's** checksum format.

# Checksum Generator

This project is a Rust-based implementation of a checksum generator for text files. It reads a file line by line, calculates a checksum for each line, and outputs the result to a new file with the checksum prepended.

### Note:
⚠️ **This implementation does not currently generate the same checksums as those used by COMPUTE! Magazine.** The algorithm used in this tool differs from the original checksum format used in the type-in programs from COMPUTE! Magazine. This tool is not intended as a direct replacement, but rather a different implementation that may be updated in the future.

## Features
- Reads text files line by line.
- Calculates a basic checksum by summing the ASCII values of each character.
- Outputs a new file with the checksum prepended to each line.

## Usage

### Building and Running
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Build and run the project using the following commands:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ./target/release/checksum inputfile.txt
   ```

3. The output will be saved in a file with the `.out` extension (e.g., `inputfile.out`).

## Future Improvements
- Implement a checksum algorithm that matches the one used by COMPUTE! Magazine.
- Support additional configurations and output formats.

### Explanation:
- The **Note** section clarifies that this tool does **not** generate the same checksum as the type-in programs from **COMPUTE! Magazine**, ensuring that users understand that this is a different implementation.
- **Future Improvements** mentions the possibility of adding compatibility with the original **COMPUTE! Magazine** checksum format.
